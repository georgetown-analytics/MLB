# Abstract
There are 162 baseball games played every season in the MLB. For comparison, the NBA has 72 games in a season, while the NFL has 17 games per season. With so many games being played every year, we get a plethora of data that we can utilize to predict if a team would win on any given day. From kaggle data sets that we found, our team wants to focus on the specific attributes in a game and create a model that can accurately predict whether a team will win or not. 

# Data Pipeline Methodology
Acquire Data (Ingestion): Extract data from sources by downloading directly from their website.
Clean Data (Wrangling): Data cleaning, feature generation and feature standardization.
Explore Data: Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify significant features
Model Data: Create baseline model using supervised machine learning methods to select features and model.
Make the Useful Model: Improve model performance (e.g., accuracy) results

# Data Sources

# Project Overview
The objective of Cohort 25’s (also referred to as “project team”) capstone project is to evaluate the relationship between attributes for a given professional team’s performance and outcome (e.g., team wins).  We hypothesize that given an appropriate volume of instances (e.g., game results) and data element features (e.g., home runs, game attendance) we can accurately predict a Major League Baseball professional team’s win total.
