Abstract
The objective of Cohort 25’s (also referred to as “project team”) capstone project is to evaluate the relationship between attributes for a given professional team’s performance and outcome (e.g., team wins).  We hypothesize that given an appropriate volume of instances (e.g., game results) and data element features (e.g., home runs, game attendance) we can accurately predict a Major League Baseball professional team’s win total.

Data Pipeline Methodology
Acquire Data (Ingestion): Extract data from sources by downloading directly from their website.
Clean Data (Wrangling): Data cleaning, feature generation and feature standardization.
Explore Data: Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify significant features
Model Data: Create baseline model using supervised machine learning methods to select features and model.
Make the Useful Model: Improve model performance (e.g., accuracy) results
